Charlie: Yes, hello again. Yes, then I was given an order to take food to that decrepit guy, not that I’m afraid of him, but he’s pretty creepy. Could you please help?
Alice: Of course, if something happens you will be a witness. But if I’m serious, the truth in any case will be revealed only when, where and with whom. But that won't matter anymore. In general, let me go.
Charlie: Here you go.
