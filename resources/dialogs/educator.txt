Mrs Rebecca: Children, just a moment! Due to recent events, I ask you to be vigilant and avoid visiting the old building if possible. Try not to believe in all sorts of rumors; the administration is working to eliminate sanitary violations. Thank you for your attention, bon appetit! Iâ€™ll also ask Charlie to come to me.
Charlie: Okay, Mrs Rebecca!
